# Nexa Core v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Nexa Core is a high-performance WebSocket server implementation in Rust, designed for scalable and reliable communication. This initial release provides a solid foundation for building real-time applications with robust connection handling and state management.

## Current Status

### Working Features

1. **WebSocket Server**
   - Stable WebSocket server implementation with configurable bind address
   - Support for concurrent connections with proper resource management
   - Automatic connection cleanup and timeout handling
   - JSON message handling with standardized response format

2. **State Management**
   - Robust server state management (Starting, Running, Stopping, Stopped)
   - Atomic state file operations for crash recovery
   - PID file management for process tracking

3. **Metrics and Monitoring**
   - Basic metrics tracking (connections, uptime, errors)
   - Connection statistics (active, total, failed)
   - Client tracking with connection timestamps

4. **Resource Management**
   - Configurable maximum connections limit
   - Connection timeout handling
   - Automatic cleanup of stale connections
   - Graceful shutdown handling

### Known Issues

1. **WebSocket Message Handling**
   - Response format could be more flexible for different message types
   - Binary message handling needs improvement
   - No built-in message validation schema

2. **Connection Management**
   - Potential race conditions in high-load scenarios
   - Connection cleanup might be delayed under heavy load
   - No automatic reconnection handling

3. **Monitoring**
   - Health monitoring implementation is basic
   - No built-in alerting system
   - Limited metric collection

## Installation

### Requirements

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Linux/Unix-based system
- 512MB RAM minimum (2GB recommended)
- 1GB disk space

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/nexa-core.git
   cd nexa-core
   ```
